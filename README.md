# VBA_Project_weight_tracker
The idea of this project is to make a Visual Basic program that will continuously help an individual achieve and maintain a certain weight, based on some given input.
The first part of information that is needed from the ndividual accessing the program is a username, password ( an oridinary log in).Then , each user is asked to input the actual weight,height,age,how active he is and lastly his goal weight on a goal time period.
As this program is aimed to be used on a daily basis, each user will be asked to enter the type of food he has consumed and also his daily activity( such as waling , running,push ups etc.) each day.
Based on scientifitic formulas, the program itself calculates the BMI, BMR of each user.
As an addition, besides counting calories, this program also calculates the types of nutritious values from each food and tells you when you've procedeed the daily limit of some sort of nutritient(for example fats)
